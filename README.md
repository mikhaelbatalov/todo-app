## A Todo Example

This pet project was started with the goal of learning new tools.
To build my first React Native app as a new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started was with Expo Go.

## Getting Started

You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator.
Install the Expo Go app on your Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.
On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.

```bash
npx degit mikhaelbatalov/todo-app todo-app
```

```bash
cd todo-app
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run start
```

## Command

### `npm install`

Install all Node Package Modules that depending this project.

### `npm run start`

On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open this project.

### `npm run tunnel`

To get a tunneled URL.
Sometimes, restrictive network conditions make it difficult to connect to the development server. 

### `npm run android`

To open in an Android Emulator.
Sometimes, it can be useful to run your app directly on your computer instead of on a separate physical device.
It requires Android Studio to get started. If you already have one of these tools installed, you should be able to get up and running within a few minutes.
If you would like to set this up, you can learn more about installing an Android Emulator.
